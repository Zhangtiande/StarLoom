# Task: Database Layer

## Description
Implement SQLite-based database layer with repository models, sync state tracking, and migration system. This foundational data layer will manage all repository metadata, synchronization state, and provide efficient querying capabilities for the StarLoom CLI.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SQLite database schema with repository models
- [ ] Migration system for schema evolution
- [ ] Repository metadata storage (name, URL, branches, etc.)
- [ ] Sync state tracking (last sync, status, conflicts)
- [ ] File change tracking and conflict detection
- [ ] Database connection pooling and management
- [ ] Query optimization for large repositories
- [ ] Data integrity constraints and validation
- [ ] Backup and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Performance: Query response time under 100ms for typical operations

## Technical Details
- Use SQLite with diesel ORM for type-safe database operations
- Implement repository table with foreign key relationships
- Track file-level changes with checksums and timestamps
- Migration system using diesel migrations
- Connection pooling for concurrent access
- Files/modules affected:
  - `src/database/` (new module)
  - `src/models/` (repository and sync models)
  - `migrations/` (database schema migrations)
  - `src/storage/database.rs` (database configuration)

## Dependencies
- [ ] SQLite database engine
- [ ] Diesel ORM and CLI tools
- [ ] Migration framework
- [ ] Connection pooling library

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 20
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and tested
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Cross-platform testing completed
