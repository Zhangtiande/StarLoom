# Task: UI Components

## Overview

Implement the core user interface components for the StarLoom repository synchronization system. This includes the authentication flow, repository list display, sync status indicators, and user controls. The UI emphasizes clarity, responsiveness, and seamless user experience during sync operations.

## Scope

### Authentication Flow UI
- OAuth 2.0 authentication interface with GitHub integration
- Clear status feedback during authentication process
- Error handling for authentication failures
- Account management and logout functionality

### Repository List Display
- Responsive repository grid/list with search and filtering
- Repository metadata display (name, description, language, stars)
- Real-time updates during sync operations
- Pagination for large repository collections

### Sync Status Display
- Real-time sync progress indicators with detailed status
- Sync controls (start, pause, cancel operations)
- Error reporting with actionable user guidance
- Sync history and last update timestamps

## Technical Requirements

### Component Architecture

#### AuthenticationFlow Component
```typescript
interface AuthenticationFlowProps {
  onAuthSuccess: (token: string) => void;
  onAuthError: (error: AuthError) => void;
  initialState: AuthState;
}
```

#### RepositoryList Component  
```typescript
interface RepositoryListProps {
  repositories: Repository[];
  loading: boolean;
  onSearch: (query: string) => void;
  onFilter: (filters: FilterOptions) => void;
  onSort: (field: SortField, direction: SortDirection) => void;
}
```

#### SyncStatus Component
```typescript
interface SyncStatusProps {
  status: SyncStatus;
  progress: SyncProgress;
  onStartSync: () => void;
  onPauseSync: () => void;
  onCancelSync: () => void;
}
```

### UI/UX Requirements

#### Responsive Design
- Adaptive layout for desktop window resizing
- Minimum window size: 800x600, optimal: 1200x800
- Component reflow for different screen proportions
- Accessible keyboard navigation throughout

#### Visual Design
- Clean, minimal interface following platform conventions
- Consistent spacing, typography, and color scheme
- Clear visual hierarchy with proper contrast ratios
- Loading states and skeleton screens for better perceived performance

#### Interactive Elements
- Hover states and click feedback for all interactive elements
- Contextual tooltips for complex features
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Cmd+R for sync, Cmd+F for search)
- Drag-and-drop support for future features (repository organization)

### State Management

#### Authentication State
- OAuth token validation and refresh handling
- User profile information (avatar, name, username)
- Authentication error states and recovery flows
- Persistent login state across application sessions

#### Repository State
- Repository collection with real-time updates
- Search and filter state persistence
- Selection state for bulk operations (future)
- Sorting preferences with local storage

#### Sync State
- Real-time sync progress and status updates
- Error state management with user-friendly messages
- Sync history tracking for troubleshooting
- Network connectivity status monitoring

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

#### OAuth Integration
1. **Initial State**: Display login prompt with GitHub branding
2. **OAuth Redirect**: Launch system browser for GitHub authorization
3. **Token Exchange**: Handle OAuth callback and token validation
4. **Success State**: Display user profile and sync controls
5. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with retry options

#### User Experience Flow
```typescript
const AuthFlow = {
  Login: () => "Connect to GitHub to sync your starred repositories",
  Authorizing: () => "Authorizing with GitHub...",
  Success: (user) => `Welcome, ${user.name}! Ready to sync ${user.starred_count} repositories`,
  Error: (error) => `Authentication failed: ${error.message}. Please try again.`
}
```

### Repository List Interface

#### Display Components
- **Repository Card**: Name, description, language, star count, last updated
- **Search Bar**: Real-time filtering with debounced API calls
- **Filter Panel**: Language, date range, star count filters
- **Sort Controls**: Name, stars, last updated, language options

#### Performance Optimizations
- Virtual scrolling for large repository collections (1000+ items)
- Lazy loading for repository README content and metadata
- Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Debounced search input (300ms) to reduce API calls

#### Accessibility Features
- Screen reader support with proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation with focus management
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Reduced motion support for animations

### Sync Status Interface

#### Status Indicators
```typescript
const SyncStatusDisplay = {
  Idle: "Last sync: 2 hours ago",
  InProgress: "Syncing repositories... (42/156)",
  Paused: "Sync paused - Click to resume",
  Failed: "Sync failed - Network error. Retry in 30 seconds",
  Completed: "Sync completed - 12 new repositories added"
}
```

#### Progress Visualization
- Linear progress bar for overall sync completion
- Circular indicator for current operation (API calls, database writes)
- Repository count display (processed/total)
- Estimated time remaining based on current sync rate

#### Control Interface
- **Start Sync**: Large, prominent button when sync is idle
- **Pause/Resume**: Toggle control during active sync
- **Cancel**: Confirmation dialog for sync cancellation
- **Settings**: Access to sync preferences and intervals

## Dependencies

### Required Tasks
- **Task 001**: Authentication System - Needed for OAuth flow and user management
- **Task 007**: Sync Engine Core - Required for sync operations and status updates

### Frontend Dependencies
- React 18+ with TypeScript for component development
- Tauri API bindings for backend communication
- CSS modules or styled-components for styling
- React Query or SWR for server state management
