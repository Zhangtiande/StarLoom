# Task: Error Handling System

## Description
Implement comprehensive error handling system with network failure recovery, API rate limit management, and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff. This system will ensure reliable operation under various failure conditions and provide clear user feedback for all error scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Structured error types with classification (network, auth, rate limit, server)
- [ ] Exponential backoff retry strategy with jitter for failed requests
- [ ] Network connectivity detection and offline mode handling
- [ ] GitHub API rate limit detection and automatic retry scheduling
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for failing services
- [ ] Error aggregation and reporting for batch operations
- [ ] User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
- [ ] Persistent error state for resume after application restart
- [ ] Monitoring hooks for error tracking and diagnostics
- [ ] Performance: >98% automatic recovery from transient failures

## Technical Details
- Custom error types with thiserror derive for structured error handling
- Exponential backoff with randomized jitter (base delay: 1s, max: 300s)
- Network connectivity polling with system network change detection
- Rate limit header parsing and proactive delay calculation
- Circuit breaker with failure threshold and recovery detection
- Error context preservation through operation chains
- Files/modules affected:
  - `src/error/` (new module)
  - `src/error/types.rs` (error type definitions)
  - `src/error/retry.rs` (retry logic implementation)
  - `src/error/recovery.rs` (recovery strategies)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Error handling library (thiserror, anyhow)
- [ ] Network connectivity detection utilities
- [ ] Async delay and timeout functionality
- [ ] System notification capabilities for offline status

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and tested
- [ ] Unit tests for all error scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests with simulated failures
- [ ] Documentation with error handling patterns
- [ ] User experience testing for error flows
- [ ] Reliability testing under network instability
