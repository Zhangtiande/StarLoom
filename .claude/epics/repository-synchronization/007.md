# Task: Sync Engine Core

## Overview

Implement the core synchronization engine that orchestrates incremental sync operations, change detection, and background processing for GitHub starred repositories. This task builds the heart of the synchronization system that efficiently manages data updates while respecting API rate limits.

## Scope

### Incremental Sync Logic
- Implement timestamp-based change detection using repository `updated_at` fields
- Build sync scheduling system with configurable intervals (default: 1 hour)
- Create differential sync to process only repositories modified since last sync
- Handle repository additions, updates, and removals from starred list

### Background Processing
- Design async sync operations using tokio runtime
- Implement non-blocking sync execution with cancellation support
- Create sync progress tracking with granular status updates
- Build sync queue management for handling large repository collections

### Change Detection
- Repository metadata change detection (name, description, language, etc.)
- README content change tracking with content hash comparison  
- Star status changes (starred/unstarred repositories)
- Repository availability detection (deleted/private repositories)

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components

#### SyncEngine Service
```rust
pub struct SyncEngine {
    github_client: Arc<GitHubClient>,
    database: Arc<DatabaseService>, 
    config: SyncConfig,
    sync_state: Arc<Mutex<SyncState>>,
}
```

#### Sync Operations
- **Initial Sync**: Full synchronization for new users or fresh installs
- **Incremental Sync**: Update only changed repositories based on timestamps
- **Forced Sync**: Manual full resync with user confirmation
- **Selective Sync**: Sync specific repositories on demand

#### Rate Limiting Integration
- Coordinate with GitHub API rate limits from GitHubClient
- Implement exponential backoff for API failures
- Dynamic sync interval adjustment based on available rate limit

### Background Task Management

#### Sync Scheduler
- Configurable sync intervals (15min, 1hr, 4hr, daily)
- Automatic sync pause during system sleep/hibernate
- Sync retry logic with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s max)
- Graceful cancellation of in-progress syncs

#### Progress Reporting  
- Real-time sync status updates via observer pattern
- Granular progress tracking (repositories processed/total)
- Error aggregation and reporting
- Sync duration and performance metrics

### Error Handling

#### Network Failures
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Partial sync recovery (resume from last successful position)
- Offline mode detection and graceful degradation
- Connection timeout handling (30s default)

#### API Rate Limiting
- Rate limit detection and automatic pause/resume
- Intelligent sync scheduling around rate limit resets
- Priority-based sync ordering (recently starred first)
- Fallback to reduced sync frequency when approaching limits

#### Data Consistency
- Atomic database operations for sync batches
- Transaction rollback on partial sync failures
- Sync state persistence across application restarts
- Corruption detection and automatic recovery

## Implementation Details

### Sync State Management
```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub enum SyncStatus {
    Idle,
    InProgress { current: u32, total: u32 },
    Paused { reason: PauseReason },
    Failed { error: SyncError, retry_count: u32 },
    Completed { duration: Duration, synced_count: u32 },
}
```

### Change Detection Algorithm
1. Fetch repository list from GitHub API with minimal fields
2. Compare `updated_at` timestamps with local database
3. Identify new, modified, and removed repositories
4. Build sync plan with priority ordering
5. Execute sync operations with progress reporting

### Background Processing Flow
1. Schedule sync task based on configuration
2. Check network connectivity and API rate limits
3. Acquire sync lock to prevent concurrent operations
4. Execute incremental sync with progress updates
5. Update sync metadata and notify UI components
6. Schedule next sync iteration

## Dependencies

### Required Tasks
- **Task 002**: GitHub API Client - Needed for repository data fetching
- **Task 004**: Database Layer - Required for sync state persistence and data storage

### External Dependencies
- GitHub GraphQL API v4 for repository data
- tokio async runtime for background processing
- reqwest HTTP client for API communication
- SQLite database for sync state and metadata
