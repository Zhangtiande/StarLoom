# Task: Testing Infrastructure

## Description
Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure including unit tests, integration tests, and mock GitHub API services. This testing foundation will ensure code quality, enable confident refactoring, and support reliable continuous integration workflows for the repository synchronization system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit test framework setup with async test support
- [ ] Mock GitHub API server for integration testing
- [ ] Test fixtures for repository data and API responses
- [ ] Property-based testing for sync logic validation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking test suite
- [ ] Database testing with in-memory SQLite instances
- [ ] Authentication flow testing with mock OAuth provider
- [ ] Network failure simulation and error injection
- [ ] Test coverage reporting and quality gates
- [ ] Performance: Test suite execution under 2 minutes

## Technical Details
- Use tokio-test for async unit testing framework
- Mock HTTP server with wiremock for API endpoint simulation
- Property-based testing with proptest for sync algorithms
- Benchmark suite with criterion.rs for performance regression detection
- In-memory SQLite databases for isolated database testing
- Test data factories for consistent fixture generation
- Files/modules affected:
  - `tests/` (integration test directory)
  - `src/testing/` (test utilities module)
  - `tests/fixtures/` (test data and mock responses)
  - `benches/` (performance benchmark suite)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Testing framework (tokio-test, rstest)
- [ ] Mock server library (wiremock)
- [ ] Property testing library (proptest)
- [ ] Benchmarking framework (criterion)
- [ ] Test coverage tools (tarpaulin)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 20
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Test framework implemented and configured
- [ ] Mock API services operational
- [ ] Test coverage >90% for core sync logic, >70% overall
- [ ] Benchmark suite establishing performance baselines
- [ ] CI/CD integration with automated test execution
- [ ] Documentation for testing patterns and practices
