# Task: Authentication System

## Description
Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication system for GitHub integration with secure token storage and credential management. This foundational system will handle user authentication, token refresh, and secure credential persistence across application restarts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 flow implementation with GitHub provider
- [ ] Secure token storage with encryption at rest
- [ ] Automatic token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Credential validation and error handling
- [ ] Cross-platform secure storage (keychain/credential manager)
- [ ] Authentication state management
- [ ] Logout and credential revocation
- [ ] Rate limiting compliance for GitHub API
- [ ] Security audit for credential handling
- [ ] Performance: Auth flow completes within 30 seconds

## Technical Details
- Implement OAuth 2.0 Device Flow for CLI applications
- Use platform-specific secure storage (Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, libsecret on Linux)
- Token refresh strategy with background renewal
- Structured error handling for auth failures
- Files/modules affected:
  - `src/auth/` (new module)
  - `src/config/auth.rs` (auth configuration)
  - `src/storage/credentials.rs` (secure storage)

## Dependencies
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 client library (oauth2 crate)
- [ ] Platform-specific credential storage libraries
- [ ] HTTP client for API requests
- [ ] Encryption library for token storage

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and tested
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Cross-platform testing completed
