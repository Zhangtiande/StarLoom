# Task: GitHub API Client

## Description
Implement comprehensive GitHub GraphQL API client with rate limiting, pagination handling, and efficient data fetching. This client will serve as the primary interface for all GitHub API interactions, featuring intelligent retry mechanisms and robust error handling for reliable repository synchronization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GraphQL client implementation with query builder
- [ ] Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm respecting GitHub limits
- [ ] Pagination handling for large result sets (>100 repositories)
- [ ] Repository metadata fetching with selective field queries
- [ ] README content retrieval with size limits and fallback handling
- [ ] Network timeout and retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- [ ] API response validation and error mapping
- [ ] Concurrent request management with connection pooling
- [ ] Performance: <2 API calls per repository per sync operation

## Technical Details
- Use reqwest with tokio for async HTTP operations
- Implement GraphQL query generation with type-safe builders
- Token bucket rate limiting algorithm (5000 requests/hour)
- Cursor-based pagination for starred repositories query
- README content fetching with 1MB size limit and encoding detection
- Structured error handling with retry classification
- Files/modules affected:
  - `src/github/` (new module)
  - `src/github/client.rs` (main API client)
  - `src/github/queries.rs` (GraphQL query definitions)
  - `src/github/rate_limit.rs` (rate limiting implementation)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Authentication System (001) for OAuth token management
- [ ] HTTP client library (reqwest with json features)
- [ ] GraphQL query generation library
- [ ] Rate limiting and caching utilities
- [ ] Async runtime (tokio) for concurrent operations

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and tested
- [ ] Integration tests with mock GitHub API
- [ ] Rate limiting verification tests
- [ ] Documentation updated with API usage examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarking completed
- [ ] Error handling scenarios tested
