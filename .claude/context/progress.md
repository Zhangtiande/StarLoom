# Project Progress

## Current Status: Design Phase

**Project State**: Early design and planning phase
**Implementation Status**: No application code written yet
**Infrastructure Status**: Complete Claude Code PM system deployed

## Completed Work

### âœ… Project Planning & Documentation
- **Design.md**: Complete requirements document in Chinese
  - Desktop application targeting Windows, macOS, Linux
  - GitHub Stars management with AI-powered analysis
  - External AI provider integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
  - User-configurable API keys and provider switching

### âœ… Development Infrastructure
- **Claude Code PM System**: Fully deployed and operational
  - 40+ management commands (`/pm:*`, `/context:*`, `/testing:*`)
  - Agent-based development workflow
  - GitHub integration capabilities
  - Parallel task execution system

### âœ… Project Configuration
- **CLAUDE.md**: Comprehensive development guidelines
- **AGENTS.md**: Agent system documentation
- **COMMANDS.md**: Complete command reference
- Development rules and patterns established

## Current Challenges

### ðŸ”„ No Git Repository
- Project exists as local directory only
- No version control initialized
- Recommendation: Initialize git repo for PM system integration

### ðŸ”„ Technology Stack Decision Pending
- Framework selection needed (Tauri, Flutter Desktop, native)
- Need to balance lightweight requirement vs development speed
- AI provider integration architecture needs design

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Repository Setup
1. Initialize git repository
2. Create initial commit with current documentation
3. Set up GitHub repository for PM system integration

### Priority 2: Technology Selection
1. Evaluate desktop frameworks (Tauri, Flutter, native)
2. Research AI provider SDK integration patterns
3. Design data storage architecture for GitHub metadata

### Priority 3: Project Structure
1. Create basic application directory structure
2. Set up development environment
3. Initialize testing framework

## Dependencies Blocking Progress

**None currently** - project is in planning phase with all planning tools available.

## Recent Activity

- Context documentation creation (current session)
- CLAUDE.md enhancement with project-specific guidance
- PM system validation and command reference completion

## Success Metrics

### Short Term (Next 2 weeks)
- [ ] Git repository initialized and synced
- [ ] Technology stack selected and justified
- [ ] Basic project structure created
- [ ] First PRD created via `/pm:prd-new`

### Medium Term (Next month)
- [ ] Core GitHub API integration implemented
- [ ] Basic UI framework established
- [ ] AI provider factory pattern designed
- [ ] First end-to-end prototype working

### Long Term (3 months)
- [ ] MVP with core features functional
- [ ] Cross-platform builds working
- [ ] User testing completed
- [ ] Performance optimization completed

## Notes

This project has excellent infrastructure for rapid development once implementation begins. The Claude Code PM system provides structured workflows that should accelerate development significantly compared to traditional approaches.
