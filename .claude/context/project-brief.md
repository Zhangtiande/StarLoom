# Project Brief

## What StarLoom Does

**StarLoom** transforms your chaotic GitHub stars list into an organized, searchable, AI-analyzed knowledge base. It automatically fetches your starred repositories, uses AI to understand and categorize them, then provides powerful search and discovery tools to help you find the right project for any need.

**Core Value**: Turn "I know I starred something for this" into "Here are 3 relevant projects with analysis of which fits best."

## Why StarLoom Exists

### The Problem
GitHub's starred repositories feature is essentially a digital junk drawer. Developers star interesting projects with good intentions but:
- Lists become unwieldy with hundreds of items
- No organization beyond chronological order
- Forget why they starred specific repositories
- No way to search by purpose or technology
- Difficult to compare similar projects
- Miss connections between related repositories

### The Solution
AI-powered automatic organization that:
- Understands what each repository does
- Groups similar projects together
- Generates searchable tags and categories
- Provides comparative analysis
- Surfaces forgotten gems from your collection

### Market Validation
- 100M+ GitHub users, 25M+ active developers
- Average active developer has 50+ starred repos
- No existing solution addresses this specific pain point
- Growing problem as developers accumulate more stars over time

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- **Performance**: < 3 second app startup, < 100ms local operations
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for core features, graceful offline degradation
- **Cross-Platform**: Native performance on Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Scalability**: Handle 1000+ starred repositories efficiently

### User Success
- **Adoption**: 1000+ active users within 6 months of launch
- **Engagement**: Average 3+ sessions per week per active user
- **Efficiency**: 80% reduction in time-to-find-repository
- **Satisfaction**: 4.5+ star rating in app stores

### Business Success
- **Product-Market Fit**: Organic user growth through word-of-mouth
- **Monetization Readiness**: Clear premium features identified and validated
- **Community**: Active user feedback and feature requests
- **Competitive Position**: Recognized as the leading solution for repository organization

## Key Objectives

### Phase 1: MVP (Months 1-2)
**Objective**: Prove core value proposition with minimal viable product

**Deliverables**:
- GitHub OAuth integration working
- AI analysis of repositories (single provider)

- 70% tag acceptance rate from AI suggestions

### Phase 2: Full Product (Months 3-4)
**Objective**: Complete feature set ready for public launch

**Deliverables**:
- Multi-provider AI support (OpenAI, Anthropic, others)
- Advanced search with multiple filters
- Cross-platform builds (Windows, Linux)
- Export functionality (JSON, CSV, Markdown)
- User customization options

**Success Metrics**:
- 500+ active users
- 85% user retention after first week
- Average 100+ repositories per user
- 4.0+ user satisfaction rating

### Phase 3: Growth (Months 5-6)
**Objective**: Scale user base and prepare for potential monetization

**Deliverables**:
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Integration with other developer tools
- API for third-party extensions

**Success Metrics**:
- 2000+ active users
- 15% month-over-month growth
- 90% of users have customized categories
- Feature requests indicating product-market fit

## Strategic Priorities

### Priority 1: User Experience
- **Intuitive Interface**: Minimal learning curve, discoverable features
- **Performance**: Fast, responsive, never feels sluggish
- **Reliability**: Never lose user data, graceful error handling
- **Customization**: Users can override AI decisions and create personal workflows

### Priority 2: AI Quality
- **Accuracy**: AI analysis should be correct 85%+ of the time
- **Relevance**: Tags and categories should be genuinely useful
- **Consistency**: Similar repositories should be categorized similarly
- **Transparency**: Users understand how AI made decisions

### Priority 3: Developer Workflow Integration
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamless, feels like natural extension
- **Export Options**: Users can extract value to other tools
- **Automation**: Minimal manual work required
- **Synchronization**: Stay current with user's GitHub activity

### Priority 4: Technical Excellence
- **Architecture**: Modular, maintainable, extensible codebase
- **Security**: Proper credential management, data privacy
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms, smart caching
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage, reliable CI/CD

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Factors
- **AI Provider Dependencies**: Reliance on external APIs for core functionality
- **GitHub API Limits**: Rate limiting could impact user experience
- **Technology Choice**: Desktop framework decision affects entire project
- **User Adoption**: Niche market might limit growth potential

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Factory pattern allows switching providers
- **Intelligent Caching**: Reduce API calls, offline functionality
- **Proven Technology**: Choose mature, well-supported frameworks
- **Clear Value Proposition**: Focus on solving real, painful problems

### Low-Risk Factors
- **Market Existence**: GitHub users and starred repos are established
- **Technical Feasibility**: All required technologies are mature
- **Competition**: No direct competitors means clear positioning
- **Development Resources**: Single developer can build MVP

## Resource Requirements

### Development Time
- **MVP**: 2 months full-time development
- **Full Product**: 4 months total development
- **Growth Phase**: 6 months to mature product

### Technology Investment
- **Development Tools**: Standard development environment
- **AI Provider Costs**: ~$50-200/month during development
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Cloud hosting for CI/CD
- **Distribution**: App store fees, code signing certificates

### Skills Required
- **Core Development**: Desktop application development
- **AI Integration**: REST API integration, async programming
- **UI/UX Design**: User interface design and implementation
- **DevOps**: Build systems, cross-platform distribution
