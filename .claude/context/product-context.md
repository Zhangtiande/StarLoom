# Product Context

## Product Overview

**StarLoom** is a cross-platform desktop application designed to help developers better organize and understand their GitHub starred repositories through AI-powered analysis and intelligent categorization.

## Target Users

### Primary User: Active GitHub Developer
**Profile**:
- Has 50+ starred GitHub repositories
- Regularly stars interesting projects but loses track of them
- Wants to rediscover and organize their collection
- Values their time and wants automated organization

**Pain Points**:
- GitHub's star list becomes unwieldy with hundreds of items
- No good way to search or filter starred repos by topic/technology
- Forgets why they starred specific repositories
- Difficult to find that "perfect library" they starred months ago

**Goals**:
- Quickly find relevant libraries for current projects
- Understand what technologies/patterns they're interested in
- Clean up and organize their digital knowledge collection
- Discover connections between different starred projects

### Secondary User: Technical Team Lead/Architect
**Profile**:
- Curates technology choices for their team
- Stars repositories for evaluation and future reference
- Needs to justify technology decisions with analysis
- Manages knowledge sharing within team

**Pain Points**:
- Need to provide summaries of why certain libraries were chosen
- Hard to compare similar libraries they've starred
- Team members ask about previously evaluated technologies
- No systematic way to track evaluation criteria

**Goals**:
- Generate reports on technology evaluations
- Create curated lists for team reference
- Track evolution of their technology interests
- Share organized knowledge with team members

## Core Functionality

### GitHub Integration
**Features**:
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with GitHub
- Fetch complete list of user's starred repositories
- Sync repository metadata (name, description, language, README)
- Respect API rate limits with intelligent caching

**Value Proposition**: Seamless integration with existing GitHub workflow, no manual data entry required.

### AI-Powered Analysis
**Features**:
- Automatic project summarization using configurable AI providers
- Intelligent tag generation based on repository content
- Technology stack detection and categorization
- Similarity analysis between repositories

**Value Proposition**: AI does the heavy lifting of understanding and categorizing hundreds of projects that would take hours manually.

### Intelligent Organization
**Features**:
- Automatic grouping by technology, purpose, or pattern
- Smart tag suggestions with user approval workflow
- Duplicate/similar project detection
- Category hierarchy creation

**Value Proposition**: Transform chaotic star list into organized, navigable knowledge base.

### Advanced Search & Discovery
**Features**:
- Full-text search across repository content
- Filter by tags, languages, topics, date starred
- "Show me similar projects" recommendations
- "Find libraries for X purpose" queries

**Value Proposition**: Find the right tool for the job quickly, even from hundreds of starred repos.

### User Control & Customization
**Features**:
- Manual tag editing and custom categories
- AI provider switching (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Export organized data to various formats
- Backup and sync preferences

**Value Proposition**: Users maintain control while benefiting from AI assistance.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: "The Rediscoverer"
**Scenario**: Developer starting new React project, vaguely remembers starring some useful React libraries

**Workflow**:
1. Opens StarLoom, searches "React component library"
2. Sees categorized results with AI-generated summaries
3. Finds three component libraries with pros/cons analysis
4. Quickly evaluates options using AI summaries
5. Clicks through to GitHub for chosen library

**Outcome**: Finds perfect library in 2 minutes instead of scrolling through 200+ stars for 20 minutes.

### Use Case 2: "The Curator"
**Scenario**: Tech lead preparing architecture review, needs to present options for API framework

**Workflow**:
1. Filters starred repos by "API framework" category
2. Exports comparative analysis generated by AI
3. Reviews AI-generated pros/cons for each option
4. Customizes analysis with team-specific considerations
5. Presents polished comparison to architecture committee

**Outcome**: Professional analysis ready in minutes instead of hours of manual research.

### Use Case 3: "The Spring Cleaner"
**Scenario**: Developer realizes their stars list is cluttered with outdated/abandoned projects

**Workflow**:
1. Views "Potentially Outdated" category (AI-detected inactive projects)
2. Reviews AI analysis of project activity and alternatives
3. Bulk unstar deprecated projects
4. Discovers modern alternatives suggested by AI
5. Stars and categorizes replacement projects

**Outcome**: Clean, current, relevant collection of starred repositories.

### Use Case 4: "The Explorer"
**Scenario**: Developer wants to understand their technology interests and discover blind spots

**Workflow**:
1. Views technology breakdown dashboard
2. Sees they have many frontend but few backend libraries
3. Uses "Find similar to X" to discover backend tools
4. Reviews AI-suggested categories they haven't explored
5. Stars and categorizes new discoveries

**Outcome**: Expanded technical knowledge and more balanced repository collection.

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- **Daily Active Users**: Regular usage indicates value
- **Session Duration**: Longer sessions indicate engagement
- **Repository Actions**: Stars/unstars triggered by app usage
- **Category Creation**: Users customizing their organization

### Efficiency Gains
- **Search Success Rate**: Users finding what they're looking for
- **Time to Discovery**: Reduced time from search to repository click
- **Organization Completion**: Users completing AI-suggested categorizations
- **Export Usage**: Users extracting value for external use

### AI Effectiveness
- **Tag Acceptance Rate**: Users accepting AI-generated tags
- **Summary Usefulness**: User feedback on AI summaries
- **Category Accuracy**: AI grouping alignment with user expectations
- **Provider Switching**: Users trying different AI providers

## Competitive Landscape

### Current Solutions
**GitHub Stars Native**:
- Basic chronological list
