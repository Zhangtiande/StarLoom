# PRD: Repository Synchronization

## Executive Summary

The Repository Synchronization feature is the foundational data layer for StarLoom, enabling secure and efficient synchronization of users' GitHub starred repositories through access tokens. This system will fetch, store, and maintain up-to-date repository metadata that powers all downstream AI analysis, categorization, and search features.

**Value Proposition**: Provide seamless, secure access to users' GitHub stars data while respecting API limits and ensuring excellent performance through intelligent caching and incremental updates.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
StarLoom requires comprehensive access to users' GitHub starred repositories to provide AI-powered analysis, organization, and discovery features. Currently, there is no mechanism to:
- Authenticate with GitHub and access private starred repositories data
- Fetch detailed repository metadata including README content for AI analysis
- Maintain synchronized, up-to-date local cache of repository information
- Handle GitHub API rate limiting gracefully
- Provide offline access to previously synced data

### Why is this important now?
This is a foundational requirement that blocks all other StarLoom features. Without repository synchronization:
- AI analysis cannot access repository content
- Users cannot organize or search their starred repositories
- The application has no core functionality
- We cannot demonstrate value proposition to early users

The GitHub API provides rich metadata that competitors don't effectively leverage, creating our competitive advantage opportunity.

## User Stories

### Primary User Persona: Active GitHub Developer
**Background**: Developer with 100+ starred repositories, wants to organize and rediscover projects

#### User Story 1: Initial Setup
**As a** StarLoom user  
**I want to** connect my GitHub account securely  
**So that** I can access and organize my starred repositories  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User can authenticate via GitHub OAuth 2.0 or Personal Access Token
- Authentication flow is secure and follows GitHub best practices
- User receives clear feedback about authentication status
- Failed authentication provides actionable error messages

#### User Story 2: Repository Discovery
**As a** StarLoom user  
**I want to** see all my starred repositories with rich metadata  
**So that** I can understand what I've collected over time  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All starred repositories are fetched and displayed
- Repository metadata includes: name, description, language, stars, forks, topics
- README content is available for AI analysis
- Last updated and starred dates are shown
- Private repositories are handled appropriately

#### User Story 3: Incremental Sync
**As a** StarLoom user  
**I want** my repository data to stay current automatically  
**So that** I don't need to manually refresh or lose new stars  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- New starred repositories appear automatically
- Unstarred repositories are removed from local data
- Repository metadata updates reflect recent changes
- Sync process doesn't interfere with application usage
- User can trigger manual sync when desired

#### User Story 4: Offline Access
**As a** StarLoom user  
**I want to** access my organized repositories when offline  
**So that** I can continue working without internet connectivity  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Previously synced data remains accessible offline
- User receives clear indication when data may be stale
- Sync resumes automatically when connectivity returns
- No data corruption occurs during offline/online transitions
